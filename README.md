This is a simple company name cleaner that is meant to be used with a relational database such as AirTable or Google Sheets. 

This company name cleaner will effectively split company names at each space, and run logic against each split piece of the name before concatenating the company name back together resulting in much cleaner data. 

I am a budding developer, so if you have any questions/concerns/suggestions, I would love to hear them.
